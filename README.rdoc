Monitor My Air is an individual Ruby on Rails project I did while at Turing School. Monitor My Air provides current forecasted data on air quality as it relates to usersâ€™ specific health conditions.  Data are available as reports, email or text notifications, and as a consumable API.  My areas of focus for this project were: OmniAuth, APIs,VPS, AJAX, jQuery and Cron.
